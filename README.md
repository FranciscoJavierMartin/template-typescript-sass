# template-typescript-sass
A template to start a project with TypeScript, Sass and Gulp.js

The project structure is the following
```
docs
src
|_ts
|_scss

```
You should put your typescripts files in `ts` folder and the `scss` in the folder with the same name ( you can create subfolder for better organization of your code ).

The outputs are send to `docs` folder to be showed in Github pages, activating the option in settings.

Currently only contains tasks to compile and minify Typescript and SASS. In the future, I will add more tasks.
